# Deserialize-String

Write a function, which takes the output from Serialize String and turns it back into a string. 

Until you receive the line “end”, you will receive several lines of input on the console, in the following format: 

"{letter}:{index1}/{index2}/{index…}/{indexN}" 

Your task is to take every letter and its index and form a string out of them.
